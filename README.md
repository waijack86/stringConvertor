# stringConvertor
 
Python project created for Setel System Reliability Assignment: Problem 1. 

Using object-oriented concepts, create a CLI tool that accepts a string and does the following to it:
- converts the string to uppercase and outputs it to stdout.
- converts the string to alternate upper and lower case and outputs it to stdout.
- creates a CSV file from the string by making each character a column in the CSV and then output "CSV created!" to stdout.
